# Copilot Instructions for python_practice

## Overview
This repository contains basic Python scripts for learning and practicing core Python concepts. Each file demonstrates a specific topic, such as printing, floating-point operations, integer handling, and operators. There is no complex architecture or multi-file data flow; each script is standalone and focused on a single concept.

## File Structure
- `1.1. printing with pythong.py`: Demonstrates Python print statements and output formatting.
- `floating_demo.py`: Shows floating-point arithmetic and related functions.
- `integer_demo.py`: Covers integer operations and type conversions.
- `operatorDemo.py`: Explains Python operators with examples.

## Developer Workflow
- **No build system or test framework is present.**
- Run scripts directly using Python:
  ```powershell
  python <filename>
  ```
- No external dependencies or requirements files detected.
- No integration with external services or APIs.

## Conventions & Patterns
- Each file is self-contained and does not import from other files in the repo.
- Naming follows the topic being demonstrated; filenames may include spaces or mixed casing.
- Scripts use simple print statements and basic Python syntax.
- No classes, functions, or advanced patterns are used unless the topic requires it.

## Examples
- To run the printing demo:
  ```powershell
  python "1.1. printing with pythong.py"
  ```
- To run the floating-point demo:
  ```powershell
  python floating_demo.py
  ```

## Guidance for AI Agents
- Focus on clarity and simplicity in code examples.
- When adding new scripts, follow the pattern of topic-focused, standalone files.
- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity or dependencies.
- Use descriptive filenames that match the concept being demonstrated.
